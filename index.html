    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> May 2025</p>

    <p>
      This Privacy Policy explains how Ecomm Chat ("we", "our", or "us") collects, uses, and protects user data. This application is intended for internal communication between businesses, employees, and clients.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Personal Information:</strong> Name, email, Aadhar (for employees), and profile photo.</li>
      <li><strong>Authentication:</strong> Email and password via Firebase Authentication.</li>
      <li><strong>Media & Files:</strong> Images, videos, PDFs, and documents via Firebase Storage.</li>
      <li><strong>Device Info:</strong> Device tokens for push notifications using Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>To verify and authenticate users via secure login.</li>
      <li>To facilitate real-time chat, media sharing, and group calling.</li>
      <li>To enable admins to manage roles, monitor activity, and send broadcasts.</li>
      <li>To send real-time push notifications (messages, calls, system alerts).</li>
      <li>To maintain and improve app functionality and communication experience.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>
      We do not share your data with any third parties. All user data is stored securely in Google Firebase services and is only accessible to authorized users based on their roles (admin, employee, client).
    </p>

    <h2>4. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>
      We retain your data as long as your account is active. If your account is blocked by an admin, data remains stored securely and can be reactivated later. Account deletion is possible by user request.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Account and Data Deletion</h2>
    <p>
      Users can delete their account through the appâ€™s settings or by contacting us. Upon deletion, personal data such as name, email, and profile image will be permanently removed from our servers.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Important:</strong> Messages and media you sent to others before account deletion will remain visible to the recipients. This is consistent with how most messaging platforms operate.
    </p>
    <p>
      To request deletion, contact us at <a href="mailto:saumya.thakur.dev@gmail.com">saumya.thakur.dev@gmail.com</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      Our services are not directed to individuals under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Data Security</h2>
    <p>
      We use Google Firebase's secure infrastructure to protect data. All network communication is encrypted using HTTPS. Access control, authentication, and storage are managed securely using Firebase tools.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Your Rights</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Access, update, or delete your personal information.</li>
      <li>Request account deactivation or deletion via the app or email.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>9. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may occasionally update this policy. Users will be notified via in-app messages or email. Continued use of the app after changes implies acceptance.
    </p>

    <h2>10. Contact Us</h2>
    <p>

      <strong>Email:</strong> <a href="mailto:saumya.thakur.dev@gmail.com">saumya.thakur.dev@gmail.com</a><br/>
